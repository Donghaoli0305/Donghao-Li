This is a updated assignment of the vacuum Agent assignment it implement utility functions
Here are specific requirements:
  • Version 1: Use the following random rule
  – possiblemove(X) :- random_member (X, [left, right, back,
  forward]).
  • Version 2: Use the following instead of the random
  rule above.
  – possiblemove(left). possiblemove(right).
  possiblemove(back). possiblemove(forward).
  • Question:
  – Run the programs with version 1 and 2. How would the
  robot behave differently for Version 1 and Version 2? And
  why?

  1. Modify your original vacuum world program with the code provided in
  this PPT file so that the robot will be a utility-based robot. Show the
  code in your report and run script.
  – The utility function is sqrt(x)
  2. Change the values of
    1. reward(5), probability(0.5), and energyuse(1) so that robot would be less or
    more willing to move. Observe the behaviors. Write a couple of paragraphs of
    explanations for your observations. You must explain the behaviors based on
    these changed values.
  3. Alternative utility function can be a risk-seeking function. For example, x2
  is one.
    1. Implement this function and replace the existing risk-averse function.
    2. Do the same exercise in 2.1 above.
